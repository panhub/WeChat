 * 1. LogDelegate: By default this class redirects FFmpeg output to NSLog. As another
 * option, it is possible not to print messages to NSLog and pass them to a LogDelegate
 * function. This function can decide whether to print these logs, show them inside another
 * container or ignore them.
 *
 * 2. setLogLevel:/getLogLevel: Use this methods to see/control FFmpeg
 * log severity.
 *
 * 3. StatsDelegate: It is possible to receive statistics about ongoing operation by
 * defining a StatsDelegate or by calling getLastReceivedStats
 * method.
 *
 * 4. Font configuration: It is possible to register custom fonts with
 * setFontconfigConfigurationPath: and
 * setFontDirectory:with: methods.
 *
 * PS: This class is introduced in v2.1 as an enhanced version of older Log class.

 * Enables log and statistics redirection.

 * Statistics redirection behaviour is similar. Statistics are not printed at all if redirection is not enabled.
 * If it is enabled then it is possible to define a statistics delegate but if you don't, they are not printed
 * anywhere and only saved as 'lastReceivedStatistics' data which can be polled with 'getLastReceivedStatistics()'.
 * Note that redirection is enabled by default. If you do not want to use its functionality please use
 * 'disableRedirection()' to disable it.
