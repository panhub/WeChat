[01:09.32]There's a place in your heart
[01:12.08]And I know that it is love
[01:15.33]And this place could be much
[01:17.16]Brighter than tomorrow
[01:21.27]And if you really try
[01:23.92]You'll find there's no need to cry
[01:27.30]In this place you'll feel
[01:28.89]There's no hurt or sorrow
[01:33.33]There are ways to get there
[01:36.27]If you care enough for the living
[01:39.16]Make a little space
[01:42.34]Make a better place
[01:44.81]Heal the world
[01:47.72]Make it a better place
[01:51.13]For you and for me
[01:53.47]And the entire human race
[01:56.39]There are people dying
[01:59.99]If you care enough for the living
[02:02.97]Make it a better place
[02:04.49]For you and for me
[02:11.62]If you want to know why
[02:14.34]There's love that cannot lie
[02:17.39]Love is strong
[02:18.72]It only cares of joyful giving
[02:23.35]If we try we shall see
[02:26.15]In this bliss we cannot feel
[02:29.22]Fear of dread
[02:30.56]We stop existing and start living
[02:35.61]The it feels that always
[02:39.01]Love's enough for us growing
[02:41.51]So make a better world

[03:13.76]Will reveal a joyful face
[03:17.03]And the world we once believed in
[03:19.41]Will shine again in grace
[03:23.05]Then why do we keep strangling life
[03:26.13]Wound this earth crucify its soul
[03:28.92]Though it's plain to see
[03:30.30]This world is heavenly
[03:32.06]Be god's glow
[03:34.69]We could fly so high
[03:37.34]Let our spirits never die
[03:40.45]In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
[03:46.17]Create a world with no fear
[03:49.08]Together we cry happy tears
[03:52.17]See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
[03:58.70]We could really get there
[04:01.56]If you cared enough for the living
[04:04.34]Make a little space
[04:07.28]To make a better place
